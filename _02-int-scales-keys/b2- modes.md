**Pentatonic Scales Tricks**

-Take out the tri-tone notes (Degree 4 and 7) from the major scale for major pentatonic.

-Minor pentatonic can be remembered as taking out scale degree 2 and 6.

-Major and Minor are the same pitches, but just organized in a different order (different starting point). They are modes of each other.

**Bobby McFerrin Video**

He could demonstrate that the pentatonic scale can be used independently and easily taught. 

Even though it is missing the two notes that we considered important scale degrees, if can still be expressive and interesting (and it is in our bones).
